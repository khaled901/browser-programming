# Lecture 03 — CSS Basics

## What I implemented this lecture
- Linked an external CSS file to the HTML page
- Applied basic typography for better readability
- Used margin and padding to create spacing between sections
- Styled header, footer, and navigation using CSS
- Made images responsive and constrained the main layout width

## CSS selectors I used (at least 5)
- `body` (element selector)
- `header, footer` (group selector)
- `nav a` (descendant selector)
- `.card` (class selector)
- `#portfolio` (ID selector)
- `nav a:hover` (pseudo-class selector)

## One thing I struggled with
- Understanding the difference between margin and padding and where to use each one correctly

## One improvement I want to do next
- Improve the layout and responsiveness further using more advanced CSS techniques
