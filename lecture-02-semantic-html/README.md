# Lecture 02 – Semantic HTML & Structure

## 1. What I implemented this lecture
- Created a semantic HTML portfolio page using header, main, section, article, and footer.
- Added a portfolio section with images, links, and an embedded video using iframe.
- Added an areas of interest section using a structured list.
- Applied basic accessibility features such as alt text, skip link, and heading hierarchy.

## 2. Semantic decisions I made (REQUIRED)

### Decision 1
- **Element(s) used:** header, nav
- **Where in the page:** At the top of the page
- **Why this element is semantically correct:**
  The header element contains introductory content and navigation links, which helps define the purpose of the page.

### Decision 2
- **Element(s) used:** main, section, article
- **Where in the page:** Main content area and portfolio section
- **Why this element is semantically correct:**
  The main element represents the primary content, while section and article logically group related and standalone content.

### Decision 3
- **Element(s) used:** figure, figcaption, iframe
- **Where in the page:** Inside portfolio projects
- **Why this element is semantically correct:**
  Figure and figcaption associate media with descriptions, and iframe is appropriate for embedding external video content.

## 3. Accessibility considerations
- Added a skip link to allow keyboard users to skip directly to the main content.
- Used proper heading hierarchy (h1, h2, h3).
- Added meaningful alt text for images.
- Used semantic landmarks to improve screen reader navigation.

These features improve usability and accessibility for all users.

## 6. Notes about AI usage (if any)
